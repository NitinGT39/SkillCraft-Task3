# SkillCraft - Task 3 ðŸš€

A machine learning project to **predict whether a customer will subscribe to a bank product or not** using classification algorithms on the Bank Marketing Dataset.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The project uses the **Bank Marketing Dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).

- `bank.csv`: Cleaned dataset
- `bank-full.csv`: Full dataset with all records

Each row represents a marketing interaction with a customer, along with customer attributes like age, job, marital status, balance, etc.

## ðŸ“Š Algorithms Used

- Decision Tree Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest

Each model is evaluated on:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion Matrix
